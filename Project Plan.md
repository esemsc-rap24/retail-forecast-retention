# Project Plan: Retail Forecast & Retention Analysis

## 1. Project Overview
This project aims to analyze retail transaction data to provide actionable insights for sales improvement, demand forecasting, and customer retention strategies. The deliverables include a data analysis report, predictive models, and a management presentation.

## 2. Objectives
- Analyze sales data to identify key business insights for management.
- Forecast sales demand for the next 6 months and recommend stock strategies.
- Develop a Customer 360 model to identify high-value and at-risk customers.
- Propose actionable recommendations for improving sales and customer retention.

## 3. Deliverables
- **Presentation (max 7 slides):** Summary of analysis, insights, and recommendations.
- **Code/Notebooks:** Python (.ipynb) or other relevant files for analysis and modeling.
- **References:** Citations for any external code or resources used.

## 5. Methodology
### 5.1 Data Analysis
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) for sales, products, and customers

### 5.2 Demand Forecasting
- Time series analysis and forecasting (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet, or ML models)
- Model evaluation (e.g., RMSE, MAE)
- Forecast sales for next 6 months
- Identify products to stock up

### 5.3 Customer 360 & Retention
- Customer segmentation (e.g., RFM analysis, clustering)
- Churn prediction modeling (classification)
- Identify high-value and at-risk customers
- Recommend personalized campaigns and product offers

## 6. Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, statsmodels, Prophet, etc.)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, or PowerBI (if required)

## 7. Risks & Mitigation
- **Data Quality Issues:** Address with thorough cleaning and validation.
- **Model Limitations:** Use multiple models and cross-validation.
- **Time Constraints:** Prioritize key deliverables and automate where possible.

## 8. References
- Cite all external code, libraries, and resources in the code and presentation.
