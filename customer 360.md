awesome—here’s a tight, end‑to‑end **Customer 360 notebook blueprint** you can drop into your repo. for each section I list: (a) what to build/output in the notebook and (b) the storyline beats you’ll use in the exec deck—connected back to our earlier analysis + forecast.

# Customer 360 – Notebook Skeleton with Storyline

## 0) Environment & Project Context

**Key output (notebook):** imports, constants (e.g., churn window), random seed, paths.
**Key storyline:** “This Customer‑360 extends our earlier work—same cleaned data foundation, now focused on retention & personalization to fix the leaky bucket.” Findings to anchor: stagnation (–1.2% YoY in 2011), 37% new vs 37% lost customers, and revenue dependence on loyalists (\~44% of base → \~88% of revenue).

---

## 1) Data Load & Single Customer View (SCV)

**Key output (notebook):**

* Build `df_cust` = one row per customer with: first/last purchase dates, orders, items, revenue, AOV, recency\_days, frequency, monetary, avg\_basket\_qty, acquisition\_month.
* Join **category mix vectors** (share of spend by category) for affinity.
  **Key storyline:** “We created a unified Customer 360 table to quantify engagement and product affinity—our ‘source of truth’ for segmentation, churn, and CLV.” (Same clean dataset used in BA & Forecast work.)

---

## 2) Customer‑Level EDA & Cohorts

**Key output (notebook):**

* Distributions: orders/customer, revenue/customer, recency distribution.
* **Cohort retention curves** (by acquisition month) and **time‑to‑second‑order** analysis.
* Month‑over‑month **active customer** counts with first‑vs‑repeat split.
  **Key storyline:** “The business is leaky: retention drops from 100% → \~22% by Month 1; \~12% active by Month 11. Growth stalled not due to basket size but net customer growth & repeat weakness; loyal buyers dominate revenue.” Use these exact hooks from BA section.

---

## 3) RFM Segmentation (Baseline)

**Key output (notebook):**

* Compute **Recency, Frequency, Monetary** per customer; score (quintiles) → segment labels (e.g., Champions, Loyal, Promising, At Risk, Hibernating).
* RFM heatmap; segment sizes; revenue share by segment; segment‑level KPIs (AOV, items/order).
  **Key storyline:** “Simple, explainable segments show **where money comes from** (Champions/Loyal = small share of base, \~disproportionate revenue) and **where lift is feasible** (At‑risk with good past value). This mirrors our earlier finding: 44% loyal → \~88% revenue.”

---

## 4) Behavioral Clustering (Discovery)

**Key output (notebook):**

* K‑Means (or Hierarchical) on standardized features: recency\_days, orders, monetary, avg\_basket\_qty, **category‑mix** components, seasonality flags (Q4 buyer).
* Choose K via elbow/silhouette; profile clusters with readable names (e.g., “Holiday Gift Hunters,” “Kitchen/Beauty Loyalists,” “Home‑Decor Explorers”).
  **Key storyline:** “Beyond RFM, clusters expose **why** customers behave differently. E.g., ‘Holiday Gift Hunters’ map to categories with poor stickiness (Christmas/Toys), while ‘Kitchen/Beauty Loyalists’ align to sticky repeat categories.” (Grounded in product insights from BA.)

---

## 5) Churn Definition & Labeling

**Key output (notebook):**

* Define **churn window** (e.g., no purchase in last **90/120/180** days). Run sensitivity check to pick threshold balancing seasonality (post‑December lull) vs business cadence.
* Create binary `is_churned` + **time‑since‑purchase** features.
  **Key storyline:** “We define churn pragmatically for a seasonal business. We evaluate multiple windows because Q4 spikes and Q1 dips can make naive 90‑day rules misfire.” (Seasonality evidence from demand forecast.)

---

## 6) Churn Prediction Model

**Key output (notebook):**

* Features: recency, frequency, monetary, time since last order, **first‑category**, category mix shares, seasonality flags (Q4 buyer), discount use (if available), country (mostly UK), time‑to‑2nd‑order, days\_between\_orders stats.
* Models: **Logistic Regression** (interpretable baseline), **Random Forest/XGBoost** (nonlinear lift).
* Evaluation: ROC‑AUC, PR‑AUC, calibration plot, confusion matrix under business‑oriented threshold (optimize for **precision\@top‑N** for campaign capacity).
* Output **churn\_probability** per customer + top SHAP‑style feature importances (even permutation importance is fine).
  **Key storyline:** “We can **rank at‑risk customers** reliably. Drivers typically include **recency**, **order frequency**, and **category mix** (holiday‑heavy buyers churn more; Kitchen/Beauty buyers stick more)—consistent with our BA.”

---

## 7) CLV (12‑Month Expected Value)

**Key output (notebook):**

* **Simple CLV**: expected\_orders × expected\_order\_value × margin × survival probability (from churn model or RFM‑based survival curves). Use discount factor if desired.
* Produce **value tiers**: High, Medium, Low CLV.
  **Key storyline:** “We prioritize spend by **expected future value**, not just history. This lets us double down where ROI is highest and put lighter touches elsewhere.”

---

## 8) Next‑Best‑Category / Product Affinity (Personalization)

**Key output (notebook):**

* **Association rules** (Apriori) for category‑to‑category transitions (Home Décor → Kitchen/Beauty).
* Optional: simple **collaborative filtering** at category level to keep it robust with limited history.
* Generate **recommendation candidates** per customer/segment.
  **Key storyline:** “To fix under‑conversion of Home Décor entrants, we actively nudge into **stickier categories** (Kitchen/Food, Beauty) that correlate with loyalty.” (Directly tying to BA product insights.)

---

## 9) Campaign Design: Who, What, When

**Key output (notebook):**

* **Target lists**:

  * **Protect Tier**: Top‑CLV & Loyal (benefits/early access; minimal discount).
  * **Win‑Back Tier**: High/Med CLV + high churn probability (cross‑sell into Kitchen/Beauty).
  * **Onboarding Tier**: New Home‑Décor first‑timers, engage within **30 days** to drive 2nd order.
* **Offer playbooks** by segment: %off thresholds, bundles, content angles.
* **Calendar alignment** with forecast: heavy push **Nov–Dec** for acquisition; **Jan–Mar** focus on conversion & reactivation.
  **Key storyline:** “We turn insights into **3 concrete plays**: Protect (retain revenue core), Convert (move one‑timers to repeat), and Reactivate (win back dormant). Timing syncs with demand seasonality.”

---

## 10) Uplift & Capacity Planning (What‑if)

**Key output (notebook):**

* Simple **uplift simulation**: assume response rates by segment and discount cost → expected incremental margin. Compare **with/without** targeting vs blast.
* **Contact capacity** constraint → optimize top‑N selection by **CLV‑weighted uplift**.
  **Key storyline:** “Targeted CRM beats blanket promos. With the same contact budget, we drive higher incremental margin by prioritizing **high‑CLV and at‑risk** customers.”

---

## 11) Measurement Plan & Guardrails

**Key output (notebook):**

* **Holdout or geo‑split** for causal read.
* Primary KPIs: **repeat rate +X pp**, **churn reduction** (e.g., 37% → ≤30%), **12‑mo CLV +Y%**, and **incremental margin** after promo cost.
* Secondary: time‑to‑second‑order, mix shift into sticky categories, opt‑out rate.
  **Key storyline:** “We’ll prove ROI with controlled tests, focusing on **retention uplift** and **CLV growth**, not vanity metrics.”

---

## 12) Data Products & Handover

**Key output (notebook):**

* Persisted tables/files:

  * `customer_360.parquet` (features, segment, churn\_prob, CLV\_tier)
  * `campaign_targets_{yyyymm}.csv` (id, segment, offer, next\_best\_category)
  * `recommendations.parquet` (customer\_id, recommended\_category, confidence)
* Simple **data dictionary** in markdown.
  **Key storyline:** “This becomes a reusable asset—ops can run it monthly and marketing can self‑serve target lists.”

---

## 13) Slide‑Ready Exhibits (export)

**Key output (notebook):**

* 5 visuals:

  1. **Cohort drop‑off curve** (Month 0 → 12)
  2. **RFM heatmap** (share of revenue by segment)
  3. **Cluster profiles** (radar/bar charts)
  4. **Churn model lift chart** (precision\@k vs baseline)
  5. **Playbook matrix** (segment × action × expected uplift)
     **Key storyline:** crisp narrative arc:
* **Problem:** Flat revenue & high churn (acquisition gains erased).
* **Insight:** Loyalty tied to category path; Home Décor is an entry funnel that under‑converts; Kitchen/Beauty drive stickiness.
* **Plan:** Segment → Predict → Prioritize (CLV) → Personalize → Time to seasonality.
* **Impact:** Fewer lost customers, higher CLV, inventory and marketing aligned to demand peaks.

# Implementation Notes & “DS in Retail” pragmatics

* **Feature set (starter):** `recency_days, frequency, monetary, avg_basket_qty, aov, days_between_orders_mean/std, first_category, category_share_[x], q4_buyer, time_to_second_order, num_returns(if you have), discount_ratio(if you have), country`.
* **Label nuances:** if you pick 120 or 150 days for churn, show a small sensitivity table—don’t overfit to a single threshold (not statistically significant deltas → call it out).
* **Interpretability:** keep a logistic regression baseline for comms with business; use RF/XGB for lift.
* **Personalization scope:** start at **category** level (robust). Item‑level can be phase‑2 once you have more cycles.
* **Ops cadence:** monthly refresh before campaign calendar; weekly export in Q4.

## What this adds to the whole project story

* **Business Analysis** told us *where the revenue is leaking and which categories matter*. (Leaky base; loyal 44% → \~88% revenue; Home Décor entry, Kitchen/Beauty stickiness; seasonal spikes that don’t convert.)
* **Demand Forecasting** aligned timing and inventory: **Nov surge**, **Jan–Feb trough**, recovery by **Mar–May**—we now place the CRM plays exactly where they matter.
* **Customer 360** operationalizes the fix: segment → predict churn → push next‑best‑category → measure uplift → loop.
